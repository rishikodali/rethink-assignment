# Rethink Plaintext Editing

This is our frontend coding challenge. It gives us a chance to see your abilities and how you approach problems. It is designed to give you unlimited creative freedom as you develop a solution. Feel free to use any packages/tools/etc. you'd like to edit text as elegantly as possible. There are a variety of different file types to experiment with as you see fit.

To run the challenge:

- Clone or download this repo and `cd rethink-plaintext-editing`
- Run `npm install && npm run dev`
- Open `localhost:3000` in your browser
- Enjoy

Once complete, please email a link to a GitHub repo of clean, tested code to us. We will use Chrome to run it.
