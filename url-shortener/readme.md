## URL Shortener

```
cd url-shortener
npm install
npm start
```

- It takes in a url and returns a shortened link to the original url
- It can also take in custom urls if not already taken

### Limitations:
- Implement a way to check if the urls exist
- Implement a faster way to check if short url is taken
- Implement a LRU cache for urls
